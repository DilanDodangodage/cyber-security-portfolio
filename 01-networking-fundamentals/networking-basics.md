## Topic
Networking Basics

### Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand how devices communicate over a network and how data is transmitted between them.

### Environment
This activity was completed in a controlled lab environment using TryHackMe.

### What I Did
During this lab, I explored how devices interact to send and receive data across a network.

### How I Did It
I reviewed basic networking concepts such as addressing, basic protocols, and observed how data flows between systems.

### What I Learned
From this lab, I learned that:
- Networks allow communication
- Devices communicate using addresses
- Data is transferred in a structured way using protocols

### Why This Matters
If network communication is not properly understood or secured, it can lead to vulnerabilities, which attackers may exploit to
compromise the system.

### How to Fix
To reduce risk, organisations should implement network segmentation and ensure that network traffic is
monitored.
