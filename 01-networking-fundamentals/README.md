# Networking Fundamentals

This section covers core networking concepts from a security perspective. It focuses on how systems communicate over a network, how data is
transmitted, and how misconfigurations or weaknesses in network design can be exploited by attackers.

The content is based on hands-on lab exercises completed in controlled training environments and is documented to demonstrate conceptual
understanding rather than tool-specific usage.

## Topics Covered
- Basic network communication
- Ports and protocols
- DNS resolution and name services

## Security Relevance
A solid understanding of networking fundamentals is essential for identifying exposed services, analysing traffic flows, and understanding how attackers discover and interact with systems during security assessments.
