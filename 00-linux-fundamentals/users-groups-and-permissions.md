## Topic
Users, Groups, and Permissions

### Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand how user permissions are used to control access to files and resources in a Linux system.

### Environment
This activity was completed in a controlled lab environment using TryHackMe.

### What I Did
During this lab, I examined how permissions are assigned to files and how users and groups affect access.

### How I Did It
I reviewed user and group ownership information and observed how user permission changes access to files without modifying
system functionality.

### What I Learned
From this lab, I learned that:
- Linux uses user and group permissions to manage access control.
- File permissions determine who can access the files.
- Group membership can allow access to the files and folders owned by the group.

### Why This Matters
If permissions or group assignments are misconfigured, it can lead to sensitive data exposure, allowing attackers to
gain system access.

### How to Fix
To reduce risk, systems should follow the principle of least privilege and regularly review
user and group permissions.
