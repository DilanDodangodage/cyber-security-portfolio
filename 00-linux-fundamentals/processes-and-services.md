## Topic
Processes and Services

### Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand how processes and services run on a Linux system and how they are managed.

### Environment
This activity was completed in a controlled lab environment using TryHackMe.

### What I Did
During this lab, I examined how services are started, run, and managed on a Linux system.

### How I Did It
I observed running processes and services and reviewed how these affect system behaviour without making changes.

### What I Learned
From this lab, I learned that:
- A process is a running program
- Services are background processes that can be started manually or automatically
- Some processes run on cron jobs 

### Why This Matters
If unnecessary or misconfigured services are running, it could compromise the system and increase the risk of
unauthorised access.

### How to Fix
To reduce risk, systems should only run the mandatory services and processes that need regular monitoring and review the logs to identify anomalies.
