# Linux Fundamentals

This section covers core Linux fundamentals from a security perspective. It focuses on understanding how Linux systems are structured, how access
is controlled, and how misconfigurations can be abused by attackers.

The content is based on hands-on lab exercises completed in controlled training environments and is documented to reflect real-world security
thinking rather than simple command usage.

## Topics Covered
- Linux filesystem structure and navigation
- Users, groups, and file permissions
- Processes and services
- Basic system monitoring concepts

## Security Relevance
Linux is widely used in servers, cloud infrastructure, and security tooling. A strong understanding of Linux fundamentals is essential for identifying misconfigurations, performing enumeration, and understanding privilege escalation paths during security assessments.
