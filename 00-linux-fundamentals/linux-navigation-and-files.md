## Topic
Linux Navigation and Files

### Objective
The objective of this lab was to understand how to navigate through the system and how users interact with files and directories in Linux.

### Environment
This activity was completed in a controlled lab environment using TryHackMe.

### What I Did
During this lab, I explored the Linux system hierarchy by moving through directories and inspecting files.

### How I Did It
I used basic Linux navigation and inspection commands without modifying the file system.

### What I Learned
From this lab, I learned that:
- Linux systems organise files in a hierarchy
- Files and directories have permissions
- Access to files depends on the permissions

### Why This Matters
If someone does not understand Linux navigation, it can lead to misconfiguration, which attackers may exploit to gain unauthorized access to the system.

### How to Fix
To reduce risk, systems should be configured to limit access to sensitive data and only allow authorized users to access it.
